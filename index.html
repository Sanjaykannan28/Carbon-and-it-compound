            All the things in the world made up of carbon and other many
            elements but carbon is always present every where.For example our body is made of carbon.
            if the substance is made of hydrojen adn carbon its hydro carbons.
            they are classifed many into three type Alkane, Alkene, Alkyne.
            <h2 class="allotope"> Allotopes of Carbon</h2>
            <p class="cat"> Allotopes means the carbon are obtained mainly in molecular  form of only carbon atoms
                .</p>
