        <h1 class="rahul"> Carbon and its compound</h1>
        <h2 class="intro"> Introduction</h2>
        <p class="text"> 

            All the things in the world made up of carbon and other many
            elements but carbon is always present every where.For example our body is made of carbon.
            if the substance is made of hydrojen adn carbon its hydro carbons.
            they are classifed many into three type Alkane, Alkene, Alkyne.
            <h2 class="allotope"> Allotopes of Carbon</h2>
            <p class="cat"> Allotopes means the carbon are obtained mainly in molecular  form of only carbon atoms
                .</p>
            <p class="types">
                 1.Diamont</p>
                <p class="grahite">2.Grahite</p>
               <p class="full">3.buckminsterfullerene</p>
            </p>
            <h2 class="hydro"> Hydrocarbons</h2>
            <p class="ala"> If the compound or subatnce contains both hydrojen and carbon then its called
                as Hydrocarbons. These Hydro carbons divided into two manner they are saturated and unsaurated
                <h2 class="saturated"> Saturated hydro carbons</h2>
                <p class="def"> Saturated  means the carbon and hydrojen and bonded with only single bond.
                    Thats is Alkane only .
                </p>
                <h2 class="Alkane"> Alkane</h2>
